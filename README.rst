Digital DC Power Supply
=======================

This repository contains all documentation and files related to the
digital DC bench power supply kit that I have built.  I purchased the
kit (including a LCD display and an ATmega8) from tuxgraphics.org in
October 2006 for |euro| 40.

As of 2015-12-12, there are three separate hardware versions.  I have
hardware version 1.0 which is documented at `linuxfocus.org
<http://linuxfocus.org/English/Archives/>`_.  That site has not been
updated since 2005-12-09, which is why I have collected the
documentation here.

* `Part 1: The Hardware (article 379) <doc/lf-2005_06-0379.pdf>`_
* `Part 2: The Software (article 383) <doc/lf-2005_07-0384.pdf>`_
* `Part 3: Command and Control from the PC (article 389) <doc/lf-2005_09-0389.pdf>`_
* `Circuit Diagram (upd4) <doc/powersupply_upd4.pdf>`_

`Version 0.4.9 of the software <digitaldcpower-0.4.9/>`_ was
downloaded from the `article 389 download page
<http://linuxfocus.org/common/src2/article389/>`_.
